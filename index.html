<p>There are not yet any comprehensive books on emotion analysis from
text, but there are a set of related books:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/affective-computing">The
book on affective computing by Rosalind W. Picard.</a>. This book is
broader than this class and discusses emotions and affect as it is
modelled with computers in more general.</li>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139084789">The book on
sentiment analysis by Bing Liu</a> <a
href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/SentimentAnalysis-and-OpinionMining.pdf">(online
version is available here</a>). This book focuses on text analysis, but
more on opinion mining and sentiment analysis, less on emotions.</li>
<li><a
href="https://www.guilford.com/books/Handbook-of-Emotions/Barrett-Lewis-Haviland-Jones/9781462536368/editors">The
handbook of emotions by Feldman Barrett, Lewis, Haviland-Jones</a>. This
book provides a very good overview on the theories of emotions from a
psychological perspective.</li>
</ul>
