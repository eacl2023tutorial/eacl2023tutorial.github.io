## Proposed reading

There are not yet any comprehensive books on emotion analysis from text, but there are a set of related books:

* [The book on affective computing by Rosalind W. Picard.](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/affective-computing). This book is broader than this class and discusses emotions and affect as it is modelled with computers in more general.
* [The book on sentiment analysis by Bing Liu](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139084789) [(online version is available here](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/SentimentAnalysis-and-OpinionMining.pdf)). This book focuses on text analysis, but more on opinion mining and sentiment analysis, less on emotions.
* [The handbook of emotions by Feldman Barrett, Lewis, Haviland-Jones](https://www.guilford.com/books/Handbook-of-Emotions/Barrett-Lewis-Haviland-Jones/9781462536368/editors). This book provides a very good overview on the theories of emotions from a psychological perspective.
