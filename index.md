## Welcome

Welcome to our tutorial on emotion analysis from text. We are happy that you are interested in the topic. On this page, we would like to provide you with a little bit of information such that you can decide to participate. We will also share the material here shortly before or after the tutorial took place.

## Lecturers

The tutorial will be given by two people:

* [Šanja Stajner](https://stajnersanja.wixsite.com/sanja)

# Sessions

## Session 1 [09:00 – 10:30]

* Emotion theories in psychology
* Emotion recognition reliability in vision and language and what we can expect in NLP
* Use cases and social impact
* Resources for emotion classification and intensity prediction
* Interactive annotation exercise

**Coffee Break [10:30 - 11:15]**

## Session 2 [11:15 – 12:45]

* Non-neural models
* Multi-task and transfer-based models
* Zero-shot and few-shot learning
* Open challenges in emotion analysis
* Event evaluation-based approaches
* Emotion role labeling and stimulus/cause detection
* Ethical considerations
* Closing

## Proposed reading

There are not yet any comprehensive books on emotion analysis from text, but there are a set of related books:

* [The book on affective computing by Rosalind W. Picard.](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/affective-computing). This book is broader than this class and discusses emotions and affect as it is modelled with computers in more general.
* [The book on sentiment analysis by Bing Liu](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139084789) [(online version is available here](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/SentimentAnalysis-and-OpinionMining.pdf)). This book focuses on text analysis, but more on opinion mining and sentiment analysis, less on emotions.
* [The handbook of emotions by Feldman Barrett, Lewis, Haviland-Jones](https://www.guilford.com/books/Handbook-of-Emotions/Barrett-Lewis-Haviland-Jones/9781462536368/editors). This book provides a very good overview on the theories of emotions from a psychological perspective.

  abstract =     "Emotion analysis in text is an area of research that
                  encompasses a set of various natural language
                  processing (NLP) tasks, including classification and
                  regression settings, as well as structured
                  prediction tasks like role labelling or stimulus
                  detection. In this tutorial, we provide an overview
                  of research from emotion psychology which sets the
                  ground for choosing adequate NLP methodology, and
                  present existing resources and classification
                  methods used for emotion analysis in texts. We
                  further discuss appraisal theories and how events
                  can be interpreted regarding their presumably caused
                  emotion and briefly introduce emotion role
                  labelling. In addition to these technical topics, we
                  discuss the use cases of emotion analysis in text,
                  their societal impact, ethical considerations, as
                  well as the main challenges in the field.",
